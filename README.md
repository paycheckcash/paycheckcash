What is PaycheckCash?
----------------

PaycheckCash is an experimental digital currency that enables instant payments to
anyone, anywhere in the world. PaycheckCash uses peer-to-peer technology to operate
with no central authority: managing transactions and issuing money are carried
out collectively by the network. PaycheckCash Core is the name of open source
software which enables the use of this currency.

For more information, as well as an immediately useable, binary version of
the PaycheckCash Core software, see https://paycheckcash.net/download/, or read the
[original whitepaper](https://paycheckcash.net/paycheckcash.pdf).

License
-------

PaycheckCash Core is released under the terms of the MIT license. See [COPYING](COPYING) for more

Development Process
-------------------

The `master` branch is regularly built and tested, but is not guaranteed to be
completely stable. visit https://github.com/paycheckcash/release/ or 
http://www.paycheckcash.net/download/ for official, stable release versions of
PaycheckCash Core.


Testing
-------

Testing and code review is the bottleneck for development; we get more pull
requests than we can review and test on short notice. Please be patient and help out by testing
other people's pull requests, and remember this is a security-critical project where any mistake might cost people
lots of money.
