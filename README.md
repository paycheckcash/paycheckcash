What is PaycheckCash?
----------------

PaycheckCash is an experimental digital currency that enables instant payments to
workers, employees, contractors or anyone that works world wide. PaycheckCash uses peer-to-peer 
technology to operate with no central authority: Managing transactions and issuing money are carried
out collectively by the network. PaycheckCash Core is the name of open source
software which enables the use of this currency.

For more information, as well as an immediately useable, binary version of
the PaycheckCash Core software, see https://paycheckcash.net/download/, or read the
[original whitepaper](https://paycheckcash.org/paycheckcash.pdf).

Development Process
-------------------

The `master` branch is regularly built and tested, but is not guaranteed to be
completely stable. visit https://www.paycheckcash.org for stable releases.


Testing
-------

Testing and code review is the bottleneck for development; we get more pull
requests than we can review and test on short notice. Please be patient and help out by testing
other people's pull requests, and remember this is a security-critical project where any mistake might cost people
lots of money.
